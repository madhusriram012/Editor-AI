The official docs for this is very very dry and only explains the available endpoints without any examples so you'll have to dig through the internet to find examples. I've linked some of the resources I found useful above.

_tip: Use the multiple pages in google results and open any and every site related to your issue. You might get some insights on the API endpoints(Like how I got some info from some chinese blog)_
